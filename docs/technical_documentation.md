## Key Components

### 1. System Dynamics Model (`system_dynamics_model.R`)

The system dynamics component models the cause-and-effect relationships between key variables in DEI initiatives using stocks, flows, and feedback loops. Key elements include:

- Leadership support variables
- Cultural climate factors
- Program implementation metrics
- Organizational outcomes

This model captures the time-dependent behavior of the system, including delays, accumulations, and feedback mechanisms.

### 2. Network Analysis Model (`network_analysis_model.R`)

The network analysis component models the interactions between different stakeholders, departments, and initiatives within the organization. It represents:

- Node relationships between organizational entities
- Strength of connections between stakeholders
- Information and influence flow
- Centrality and clustering of DEI initiatives

### 3. Model Integration (`model_integration.r`)

This component connects the system dynamics and network analysis models, ensuring that changes in one domain affect the other. It handles:

- Data exchange between models
- Synchronization of time steps
- Consistency of shared variables
- Boundary conditions

### 4. Dynamic Relationship Weights (`dynamic_relationship_weights.r`)

This component implements adaptive weighting of relationships based on simulation conditions, including:

- Time-variant relationship strengths
- Contextual weighting based on organizational factors
- Adaptive importance weightings
- Reinforcement mechanisms

### 5. Nonlinear Relationships (`nonlinear_relationships.r`)

Implements the complex nonlinear relationships observed in DEI initiatives:

- Threshold effects
- J-curve relationships
- Tipping points
- Saturation effects

## Simulation Process

1. **Initialization**: Both system dynamics and network models are initialized with baseline parameters.

2. **Integration**: The models are linked through the integration layer.

3. **Simulation**: The integrated model is run forward in time, with each time step representing approximately one month of real time.

4. **Analysis**: The results are analyzed using statistical methods, Monte Carlo techniques, and scenario analysis.

5. **Visualization**: Key insights are extracted and visualized for interpretation.

## Key Parameters

The model includes several critical parameters that significantly influence outcomes:

- **Leader Support Level**: Range 0-10, critical threshold at 1.6
- **Cultural Zeitgeist Value**: Range 0-10, J-curve threshold around 1.6
- **Implementation-to-Funding Ratio**: Optimal at approximately 2:1
- **Legal Action Intensity**: Thresholds at 0.5, 2.1, 4.2, and 6.1

## Data Structures

### Primary Data Tables

1. **Scenario Results**: Outcomes across different implementation scenarios
2. **Monte Carlo Statistics**: Statistical distributions of outcomes
3. **Threshold Data**: Critical threshold values and associated outcomes
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter sensitivity measurements

## Computational Requirements

The full model simulation requires:
- R version 4.0.0 or higher
- Approximately 2-4GB of RAM
- 5-10 minutes of computation time for a complete simulation

## Limitations and Assumptions

1. The model assumes rational actors within reasonable bounds.
2. External economic factors are considered static unless explicitly modeled in scenarios.
3. The model does not account for major organizational restructuring during simulation.
4. Network relationships are assumed to evolve gradually rather than through sudden disruptions.

## Validation

The model has been validated through:
- Comparison with historical data from organizational case studies
- Expert review of behavioral patterns
- Sensitivity testing of key parameters
- Reality checks against established organizational theories
